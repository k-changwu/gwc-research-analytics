# Girls Who Code Research & Analytics Survey

Capstone project of my time at Girls Who Code as a Data & Analytics Intern in Summer 2023. Features a web survey with branching logic to be used internally between teams to facilitate more efficient cross-team functionality. 

Users go through a set of questions regarding their specific use case to determine whether to request historical data from Tableau or Salesforce.
